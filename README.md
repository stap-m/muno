# Modelling Uncertainties Ontology (MUNO)
## Description
The Modelling Uncertainties Ontology (MUNO) is a BFO-based mid-level ontology for the annotation and description of modelling uncertainties in many domains. 
MUNO was built based on the uncertainty matrix by [Walker et.al. (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1076/iaij.4.1.5.16466) and [Kwakkel et.al. (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1504/IJTPM.2010.036918).

Complex systems are full of unpredictable and uncertain behaviours that depend on many factors. 
Various fields of science have set themselves the task of studying these systems and predicting their behaviour under various premises with the help of computer models. 
[Walker et.al. (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1076/iaij.4.1.5.16466) published an uncertainty matrix to systematically record and communicate uncertainties about systems, which was extended further [Kwakkel et.al. (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1504/IJTPM.2010.036918).
MUNO takes up the matrix and models its components ontologically.
